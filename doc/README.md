Definit is a real-time dictionary companion, developed as a Google Chrome extension. It uses the Free Dictionary API: https://dictionaryapi.dev/

I created Definit not only to test what I've learned about Javascript and CSS so far, but also to challenge myself to create something that matters; something that I could genuinely see myself, or someone else, using while browsing the web. I got into coding because I wanted to make things that improve people's lives, and Definit seemed like a great place to start while also learning some new syntax along the way.

The purpose of Definit is to allow a user to quickly look up words without having to access a search engine. It pulls directly from the Dictionary API and displays your requested definitions right in the popup. It does this in two ways:

-The user can look up a word using a search bar in the popup and clicking on the "GO" button.
-Alternatively, the user can highlight any word, right-click it, and call Definit through the context menu.

Definit's core functionality is my priority, but I have several planned features to support the app as I become more experienced:

-A "Wikipedia" button that sends you to the Wikipedia page of the word you searched
-An option to change the app's color scheme (some people don't like orange... U_U;;;)
-A thesaurus feature to give you synonyms of your entered word
-A text-to-speech button that reads the word you entered out loud

Definit uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and a sprinkle of Chrome magic.
